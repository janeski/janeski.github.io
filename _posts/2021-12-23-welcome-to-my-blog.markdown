Welcome to my blog. After many years of accumulated experience in software development, I have decided to start my blog. I plan to write content about cloud architecture, agile development, agile leadership, soft skills, and almost everything related to modern software development. Here, I will share the most interesting stories from my day-to-day life as a software engineer, architect, and leader. The opinions and views are my own, not my employer's. I also write company blog posts that can be found here: https://info.nebb.com/blog/author/miroslav-janeski Stay tuned!
